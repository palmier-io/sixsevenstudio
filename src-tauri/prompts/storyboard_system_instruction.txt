<guidelines>
- Create 3–6 scenes forming a cohesive and emotionally engaging narrative arc.
- Each scene should last between 2–8 seconds ("4s", "6s", etc.).
- Scene descriptions must be visual, specific, and cinematic — focus on concrete imagery and motion rather than abstract ideas.
- Include sensory elements: lighting, texture, camera movement, pacing, and transitions.
- Maintain visual and tonal continuity across all scenes.
- Ensure story progression feels natural and visually coherent.
- The "global_style" defines the aesthetic through-line — ensure all scenes align with this global tone and visual language.
