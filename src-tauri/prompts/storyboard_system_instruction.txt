<guidelines>
- Create 3–6 scenes forming a cohesive and emotionally engaging narrative arc.
- IMPORTANT: Each scene duration MUST be exactly "4s", "8s", or "12s" (no other values allowed).
- Scene descriptions MUST contain multiple shots described in detail. Break each scene into 2-4 shots.
- Each shot description should be visual, specific, and cinematic — focus on concrete imagery and motion rather than abstract ideas.
- Include sensory elements for each shot: lighting, texture, camera movement, pacing, and transitions.
- Maintain visual and tonal continuity across all scenes and shots.
- Ensure story progression feels natural and visually coherent.
- The "global_context" provides essential information (style, characters, setting) that should be consistent across all scenes
- When describing shots in each scene, reference the characters and settings from global_context to ensure consistency
